The last row last column in the figure above shows the CoSM ICP results.

Welcome to CoSM_ICP Algorithm.
Few Notes before proceeding:
1) We don't use the installed pcl library in the system. We have our own modified PCL library present in the external_libraries folder.
2) the src/ folder contains 2 main files: CoSM_ICP_demo_Viewer.cpp and CoSM_Results_Collection.cpp.
3) CoSM_ICP_demo_Viewer.cpp is the main file which allows you to compare different methods present in the PCL library. CoSM_Results_Collection.cpp simply collects the same in a file.
